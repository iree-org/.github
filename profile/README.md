# IREE Organization

IREE (Intermediate Representation Execution Environment1) is an MLIR-based end-to-end compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a unified IR that scales up to meet the needs of the datacenter and down to satisfy the constraints and special considerations of mobile and edge deployments.

This organization consists of the IREE core plus other connectivity components to ML frameworks, benchmarking scripts, plugins and other community components.
